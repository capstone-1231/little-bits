        <p>Little Bits Therapeutic Riding Program for Persons with Disabilities (LBTRA) provides recreational riding
            programs for persons with disabilities with emphasis on development of independence, physical, emotional,
            and mental wellbeing, ability, confidence, and riding techniques. We are an inclusive, not-for-profit,
            charitable organization, established in 1975.</p>
        <p>The program is held at the Whitemud Equine Learning Centre Association (WELCA) (12510 - Fox Drive) in the
            scenic North Saskatchewan River valley of Edmonton. WELCA is serviced by the Disabled Adult Transportation
            System (DATS) system and is on an Edmonton Transit System (ETS) route. Little Bits is an independent user
            group of the WELCA facility and pays significant funds for the use of the arena and lesson horses.</p>
        <p>Class schedules consist of a 10-week winter session, a 10-week spring session and a 10-week fall session.
            Classes are run on Monday and Tuesday mornings for adults.</p>

            <p>LBTRA could not operate without the many dedicated volunteers who serve as leaders, side-walkers, and
                helping in the barn grooming and tacking up the horses. Volunteers are fully trained, and no prior
                experience is necessary. LBTRA holds a Volunteer Training Session every winter and fall.</p>

            <p>LBTRA currently registers riders onto their Waiting List via an application from our website:
                https://www.littlebits.ca/for-riders where riders are taken from the waiting list when the most
                appropriate spot becomes available for them. Riders are placed according to age and ability. </p>
