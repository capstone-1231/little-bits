            <h3>Linda R</h3>
            <p>What started as something to get me out of the house, has turned into one of
                the greatest joys in my life. At the time, I had two very young children at home. I
                felt all I was doing was changing diapers and feeding babies. One day, while
                looking through the paper, I saw an ad for volunteers at Little Bits Riding Club.
                Right up my alley, kids and horses! I went to the volunteer orientation and
                signed up to volunteer for the Sunday program. That was way back in the fall of
                1987, and it was there I met Esther MacDonald who was the instructor on
                Sunday at the time. Over that fall session, I became friends with Esther. She
                told me that in the spring of 1988, Lida McGowan was coming up to do some
                certifications for the Cheff Center in Augusta, Michigan.</p>
