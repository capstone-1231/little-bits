    <h2>In Memory Of The Horses That Have Touched Our Lives and Our Hearts</h2>
    <div>
        <div>
            <p>As former staff with hooves, the horses below are some of the retired horses that have worked with the
                Little Bits program.</p>
            <p>We are thankful for their service and dedication and cherish each one for their service.</p>

            <h3>Lollipop</h3>
            <p>Lollipop was a gentle mare that had just began her career as a horse in our program. For such a well
                schooled horse, Lollipop's gentle nature made her a top choice for riders wanting to go off lead. At
                only 13 years of age, she had an old soul, we will miss her and remember her fondly. We would like to
                thank her owner for allowing us the opportunity to get to know Lollipop, even for this brief moment.</p>

            <h3>Birdie</h3>
            <p>Birdie was a mare that was more than special, she held a special spot with her riders and those that
                worked wit her. Birdie would carefully maneuver her riders around all obstacles like a ballerina. Her
                unique colouring made her stand out and we were grateful to have her in our program. Birdie had a great
                career but she now gallops with Lillipop in fields of green.</p>

            <h3>Treasure</h3>
            <p>Treasure was a very special horse that could make everyone around him feel like they were the most
                important person in the world. Born in 1997, Treasure has an amazing life as a show horse with Dana. We
                then purchased Treasure where he arrived in 2018 only to be adopted by his second mom Ashley. She doted
                on him and taught him that photos were cool. Treasure LOVED his riders in our program and will be missed
                by everyone who ever met him. He was a true Treasure./p>

            <h3>Ali-Cat</h3>
            <p>A petite mare with the heart of gold and colouring to match, Ali-Cat helped many new riders learn how
                feel safe. Ali-Cat was a gentle soul with a touch of sass that everyone loved to work with. She would
                often touch people with her nose very gently but preferred not to get attention back unless SHE asked.
                She had many horse friends in her life but bonded with Cocoa in her later years. You would often see
                them spending time together in the field, very content.</p>

            <h3>Remy</h3>
            <p>A great warrior passed on and we will grieve him and remember him with the best memories. Remy was a true
                gentleman’s horses. Standing tall and proud, Remy would carry his riders and with ease but would always
                listen, ready for the cues to be felt from his rider. At 25, Remy showed all his talents as a steadfast
                mount that would dance his steps in any class. Remy was blessed to have an owner that allowed us to be
                graced with Remy in our classes. We will miss him but never forget him.</p>

            <h3>Rizzo</h3>
            <p>It is with a sad heart that we say goodbye to a great mare named Rizzo who was always patient, kind,
                honest and responsible. She took care of her riders with the utmost respect and gentleness and helped
                them learn confidence and independence in their classes with style. At 25 years old, Rizzo was a very
                active member of the Little Bits horse team and had a very dedicated following with her riders and
                leaders. Rizzo’s mom AnneMarie made sure that she was never wanting for love, attention and treats. </p>

            <h3>Rooster</h3>
            <p>Rooster was a horse that touched many peoples lives. He was kind, calm and was the perfect ambassador for
                all equines. Rooster had a variety of different horse jobs over the years (including TV) and later in
                life, as a horse in our Little Bits program. He made any leaders job, easy. You could often find Rooster
                drinking his hot tea while resting in his stall during the day. Roosters later years were spent as a
                retiree and greeted everyone with his soft eyes and gentle manner. He will be missed by everyone whose
                lives he touched.</p>

            <h3>Sparky</h3>
            <p>Sparky was hilarious because you never really knew where you would find him. In the lost and found box,
                on Ros’s chair, in the side-by side, walking with someone around the property or trying to get into the
                classroom. Sometimes even watching a class from the mounting block. He was a sweet boy that would let
                you know if he WANTED to have attention or not. His rules. You also had to check around your car before
                leaving as he sometimes like to play hide-and-seek with the barn staff. He will be missed.</p>
